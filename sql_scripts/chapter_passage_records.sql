(1,"5","1","<p>1&nbsp;The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</p>

<p><sup>2&nbsp;</sup>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</p>

<p><sup>3&nbsp;</sup>To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</p>

<p><sup>4&nbsp;</sup>To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</p>

<p><sup>5&nbsp;</sup>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</p>

<p><sup>6&nbsp;</sup>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>

<p><sup>7&nbsp;</sup>The fear of the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>

<p><sup>8&nbsp;</sup>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>

<p><sup>9&nbsp;</sup>For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</p>

<p><sup>10&nbsp;</sup>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</p>

<p><sup>11&nbsp;</sup>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</p>

<p><sup>12&nbsp;</sup>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</p>

<p><sup>13&nbsp;</sup>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</p>

<p><sup>14&nbsp;</sup>Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</p>

<p><sup>15&nbsp;</sup>My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</p>

<p><sup>16&nbsp;</sup>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>

<p><sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</p>

<p><sup>18&nbsp;</sup>And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.</p>

<p><sup>19&nbsp;</sup>So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>

<p><sup>20&nbsp;</sup>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</p>

<p><sup>21&nbsp;</sup>She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,</p>

<p><sup>22&nbsp;</sup>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</p>

<p><sup>23&nbsp;</sup>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>

<p><sup>24&nbsp;</sup>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</p>

<p><sup>25&nbsp;</sup>But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</p>

<p><sup>26&nbsp;</sup>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>

<p><sup>27&nbsp;</sup>When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</p>

<p><sup>28&nbsp;</sup>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</p>

<p><sup>29&nbsp;</sup>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the&nbsp;Lord:</p>

<p><sup>30&nbsp;</sup>They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</p>

<p><sup>31&nbsp;</sup>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>

<p><sup>32&nbsp;</sup>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>

<p><sup>33&nbsp;</sup>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</p>","Published","2016-12-22 21:58:49","2016-12-23 16:50:06"),
(2,"5","2","<p>2&nbsp;My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</p>

<p><sup>2&nbsp;</sup>So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;</p>

<p><sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;</p>

<p><sup>4&nbsp;</sup>If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;</p>

<p><sup>5&nbsp;</sup>Then shalt thou understand the fear of the&nbsp;Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</p>

<p><sup>6&nbsp;</sup>For the&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p><sup>7&nbsp;</sup>He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</p>

<p><sup>8&nbsp;</sup>He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</p>

<p><sup>9&nbsp;</sup>Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.</p>

<p><sup>10&nbsp;</sup>When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</p>

<p><sup>11&nbsp;</sup>Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</p>

<p><sup>12&nbsp;</sup>To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;</p>

<p><sup>13&nbsp;</sup>Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>

<p><sup>14&nbsp;</sup>Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</p>

<p><sup>15&nbsp;</sup>Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:</p>

<p><sup>16&nbsp;</sup>To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;</p>

<p><sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</p>

<p><sup>18&nbsp;</sup>For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</p>

<p><sup>19&nbsp;</sup>None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</p>

<p><sup>20&nbsp;</sup>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>

<p><sup>21&nbsp;</sup>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</p>

<p><sup>22&nbsp;</sup>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</p>","Published","2016-12-23 23:47:02","2016-12-23 23:49:45");
